Comark extends standard Markdown with component syntax, letting you embed custom UI directly in your content while keeping it readable.

## Block Components

Block components use the `::component-name` syntax and occupy their own line:

::code-group

```mdc [Syntax]
::component-name{prop1="value1" prop2="value2"}
Content inside the component

Can have **markdown** and other elements
::
```

```json [AST Output]
[
  "component-name",
  { "prop1": "value1", "prop2": "value2" },
  ["p", {}, "Content inside the component"],
  ["p", {}, "Can have ", ["strong", {}, "markdown"], " and other elements"]
]
```

::

### Examples

::code-group

```mdc [Alert]
::alert{type="info"}
This is an important message!
::
```

```mdc [Card]
::card{title="My Card"}
Card content with **markdown** support
::
```

```mdc [Empty Component]
::divider
::
```

::

## Inline Components

Inline components use the `:component-name` syntax and can be placed within text:

```mdc
Check out this :icon-star component in the middle of text.

Click the :button[Submit]{type="primary"} to continue.

The status is :badge[Active]{color="green"} right now.
```

| Syntax | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `:icon-check` | Standalone inline component |
| `:badge[New]` | Inline component with content |
| `:badge[New]{color="blue"}` | Inline component with content and properties |
| `:tooltip{text="Hover text"}` | Inline component with properties only |

---

## Component Properties

Components support two property syntaxes: inline attributes and YAML frontmatter.

### Inline Attributes

Use the `{...}` syntax for simple properties:

```mdc
::component{prop="value"}
<!-- Standard key-value pair -->
::

::component{bool}
<!-- Boolean property (becomes :bool="true" in AST) -->
::

::component{#custom-id}
<!-- ID attribute -->
::

::component{.class-name}
<!-- CSS class -->
::

::component{.class-one .class-two}
<!-- Multiple CSS classes -->
::

::component{obj='{"key": "value"}'}
<!-- Object/JSON value -->
::

::component{multiple="props" bool #id .class}
<!-- Multiple properties combined -->
::
```

### YAML Frontmatter Props

For components with many properties, use YAML frontmatter inside the component:

::code-group

```mdc [Syntax]
::component
---
title: My Component
type: info
count: 42
enabled: true
items:
  - First item
  - Second item
config:
  theme: dark
  mode: auto
---
Component content goes here

With full **markdown** support
::
```

```json [AST Output]
{
  "nodes": [
    [
      "component",
      {
        "title": "My Component",
        "type": "info",
        "count": 42,
        "enabled": true,
        "items": ["First item", "Second item"],
        "config": { "theme": "dark", "mode": "auto" }
      },
      ["p", {}, "Component content goes here"],
      ["p", {}, "With full ", ["strong", {}, "markdown"], " support"]
    ]
  ]
}
```

::

::callout{icon="i-lucide-info" color="info"}
Objects remain objects, arrays remain arrays, and numbers/booleans are parsed as their respective types rather than strings. Your components receive fully typed props.
::

**Key rules for YAML props:**

- Must be at the very beginning of the component content
- Enclosed by `---` delimiters
- Merged with inline attributes (inline attributes take precedence)
- Full support for complex data structures

### Combine Both Syntaxes

Inline attributes and YAML props can be combined. Inline attributes take precedence:

```mdc
::card{.featured}
---
title: Featured Article
author: Jane Doe
tags:
  - markdown
  - documentation
---
This combines inline class `.featured` with YAML props
::
```

### YAML Props Use Cases

**Configuration-heavy components:**

```mdc
::data-table
---
columns:
  - name: Name
    field: name
    sortable: true
  - name: Email
    field: email
    sortable: true
options:
  striped: true
  pageSize: 10
---
::
```

**API documentation:**

```mdc
::api-endpoint
---
method: POST
path: /api/users
parameters:
  - name: username
    type: string
    required: true
  - name: email
    type: string
    required: true
response:
  status: 201
  body:
    id: string
    username: string
---
::
```

---

## Component Slots

Block components support named slots using the `#slot-name` syntax:

::code-group

```mdc [Syntax]
::card
#header
## Card Title

#content
This is the main content of the card

#footer
Footer text here
::
```

```json [AST Output]
{
  "nodes": [
    [
      "card",
      {},
      [
        "template",
        { "name": "header" },
        ["h2", {}, "Card Title"]
      ],
      [
        "template",
        { "name": "content" },
        ["p", {}, "This is the main content of the card"]
      ],
      [
        "template",
        { "name": "footer" },
        ["p", {}, "Footer text here"]
      ]
    ]
  ]
}
```

::

### Combine YAML Props with Slots

You can use both YAML frontmatter props and named slots in the same component:

```mdc
::card{.featured}
---
variant: elevated
color: primary
actions:
  - label: Read More
    url: /article
  - label: Share
    icon: share
---
#header
## Article Title
*By Jane Doe*

#content
This is the main article content with **markdown** support.

#footer
Published on January 15, 2024
::
```

::callout{icon="i-lucide-triangle-alert" color="warning"}
YAML frontmatter must come immediately after the opening `::component` line, **before** any slot definitions.
::

**Correct order:**
```mdc
::component{inline-attrs}
---
yaml: props
---
#slot-name
Slot content
::
```

**Incorrect order:**
```mdc
::component
#slot-name
Slot content
---
yaml: props  <!-- This won't work -->
---
::
```

---

## Nested Components

Components can be nested within each other using additional colons:

```mdc
::outer-component
Content in outer

:::inner-component{variant="compact"}
Content in inner
:::

More content in outer
::
```

**Deep nesting:**

```mdc
::level-1
  :::level-2
    ::::level-3
    Content
    ::::
  :::
::
```

::callout{icon="i-lucide-info" color="info"}
Adding extra colons is not required but is a good practice to keep nesting visually consistent. The parser resolves nesting by matching opening and closing tags.
::

This also works:

```mdc
::level-1
  ::level-2
    ::level-3
    Content
    ::
  ::
::
```
